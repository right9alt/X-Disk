# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/X-Disk/log/*
/X-Disk/tmp/*
!/X-Disk/log/.keep
!/X-Disk/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/X-Disk/tmp/pids/*
!/X-Disk/tmp/pids/
!/X-Disk/tmp/pids/.keep

# Ignore uploaded files in development.
/X-Disk/storage/*
!/X-Disk/storage/.keep

!/X-Disk/tmp/storage/
!/X-Disk/tmp/storage/.keep
